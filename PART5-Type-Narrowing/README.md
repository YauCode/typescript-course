- Type guard an expression that checks if a variable is a specific type
- Using 'in' with Type Guards

## Park Service Volunteer Appreciation Program
The Park Service has just inherited two parks: Wolf Point Park and Raccoon Meadows. Each park has a volunteer program where volunteers help maintain the parks by cleaning campsites, planning educational events, and maintaining hiking trails. Program combines data from both parkâ€™s volunteer logs, then calculates which volunteers have the most hours.
